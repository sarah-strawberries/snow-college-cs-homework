# Snow College CS Homework

This repository contains code from homework assignments I received in classes taken at Snow College between Fall 2021 and the present date. Originally, a lot of these assignments existed in separate repositories since I was new to Git and Github, but I decided that I wanted to clean up my repositories a bit and put all the homework-related code together in its own repository.
